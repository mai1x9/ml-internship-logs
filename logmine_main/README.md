#Log Clustering and Processing Framework
This project provides a robust framework for log clustering and processing. It includes clustering algorithms, pattern generation, and multiprocessing capabilities for efficient log analysis. The system supports database integration, making it suitable for large-scale log analytics.

##Features
Clustering: Groups similar log entries based on customizable distance metrics.
Pattern Generation: Generates generalized patterns for log entries using placeholders.
Database Integration: Reads logs directly from SQLite or PostgreSQL databases.
Multiprocessing: Optimized for multi-core processing to handle large log datasets.
Modularity: Organized into reusable modules for clustering, processing, and utilities.
Scalability: Configurable batch sizes for efficient processing of millions of logs.

##Project Structure
clustering.py: Contains classes and methods for clustering logs and generating patterns.
processing.py: Handles log processing, multiprocessing, and database interactions.
utils.py: Provides helper functions and classes for scoring and miscellaneous operations.
vendor.py: Includes third-party utilities such as alignment functions (e.g., water).
log_processing.py: Handles preprocessing, log segmentation, and database log reading.
